# What is dstack?

`dstack` is an open-source orchestration engine for running AI workloads. It supports a wide range of cloud providers (such as AWS, GCP, Azure,
Lambda, TensorDock, Vast.ai, CUDO, RunPod, etc.) as well as on-premises infrastructure.

## Why use dstack?

1. Designed for development, training, and deployment of gen AI models.
2. Efficiently utilizes compute across cloud providers and on-prem servers.
3. Compatible with any training, fine-tuning, and serving frameworks, as well as other third-party tools.
4. 100% open-source.

## How does it work?

1. [Install](installation/index.md) the open-source version of `dstack` and configure your own cloud accounts, or sign up with [dstack Sky :material-arrow-top-right-thin:{ .external }](https://sky.dstack.ai){:target="_blank"}
2. Define configurations such as [dev environments](concepts/dev-environments.md), [tasks](concepts/tasks.md), 
   and [services](concepts/services.md).
3. Run configurations via `dstack`'s CLI or API.
[//]: # (The `dstack` server automatically provisions cloud resources, handles containers, logs, network, and everything else.)
4. Use [pools](concepts/pools.md) to manage instances and on-prem servers.
